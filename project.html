    <h3>National animal Tiger</h3>
    <img src="./images/tiger.jpg" alt="tiger"> <br>
    A national animal is one of the symbolic representatives of a country’s natural abundance. The choice is based on
    several criteria. The national animal may be selected based on how well it represents certain characteristics that a
    country wants to be identified with. It has to have a rich history as part of the country’s heritage and culture.
    The animal should be in abundance within the country. Mostly a national animal should be indigenous to that
    particular country and exclusive to the country’s identity. It should be a source of visual beauty. The national
    animal is also chosen based on the conservation status of the animal to enable better efforts towards its continued
    survival due to the official status.

    National animal of India is the Royal Bengal Tiger. Majestic and lethal at the same time, these are one of the most
    graceful carnivores among the Indian fauna. The Royal Bengal tiger is the symbol of strength, agility and grace, a
    combination that is unmatched by any other animal. It is representative of all these qualities as the national
    animal of India. Scientific name for the Royal Bengal Tiger is Panthera tigris tigris and it is the largest of the
    four big cats under the genus Panthera (Lion, Tiger, Jaguars and Leopards).The Royal Bengal Tiger is among the eight
    varieties of tigers found in India.

    The national bird of a country is a designated representative of that country’s fauna. It is chosen on the basis of
    the unique qualities that the bird may symbolize. It should uphold certain core qualities or values of the nation it
    belongs to. The national bird should be a prominent feature in the cultural history of the country. Another point in
    favor of being chosen as the national bird is the beauty that it embodies. The indigenous nature of the bird is
    another point while it is being considered as the national bird. Being designated as a national symbol affords the
    bird a special status with increased awareness and dedicated conservation efforts.

    National bird of India is the Indian Peafowl commonly termed as a Peacock. Vividly colorful and exuding oodles of
    grace, the Indian Peafowl commands a lot of attention. The peacock and its colors are synonymous with Indian
    identity. It is indigenous to India and Sri Lanka, but now features in countries all over the world. Peacocks are
    sometimes domesticated and kept in the garden for aesthetic purposes.

    <img width="600px" height="400px" src="./images/National-Flower-of-India.png" alt="Lotus"> <br>
    The national flower of a country should tie in with the culture, history and heritage of a nation. It is meant to
    reinforce the country’s image to the world and play a part in upholding the qualities that the nation holds true.
    The national flower of India is Lotus. It is an aquatic herb that is often termed as ‘Padma’ in Sanskrit and enjoys
    a sacred status among the Indian culture. It has been an integral part of the Indian culture from time immemorial. A
    prominent feature of the Indian mythology, the lotus is one with the Indian identity and represents the core values
    of Indian psyche.

    The Lotus symbolizes spirituality, fruitfulness, wealth, knowledge and illumination. The most important thing about
    lotus is that even after growing in murky water it is untouched by its impurity. On the other hand the lotus
    symbolizes purity of heart and mind. The National Flower 'Lotus' or water lily is an aquatic plant of Nymphaea
    species with broad floating leaves and bright aromatic flowers that grow only in shallow waters. The leaves and
    flowers of the Lotus float and have long stems that contain air spaces in them. The lotus flowers have many petals
    overlapping in a proportional pattern. The root functions of lotus are carried out by rhizomes that fan out
    horizontally through the mud below the water. Lotuses, cherished for their tranquil beauty, are delightful to take a
    look at as their blossoms open on the pond's surface.

    A particular fruit is designated as the national fruit of a country when it fulfills some key fundamental
    requirements. It must represent a powerful facet of the cultural attributes that a country wants to convey to the
    world. The fruit must have an enriching part in the country’s history. It should also have a considerable presence
    in the religious and spiritual heritage of the country. Mango, affectionately called King of Fruits is the National
    fruit of India. Its sweet fragrance and delectable flavors have won the hearts of many around the world. Mangoes

    parts, with the exception of hilly areas. Mango is a rich source of Vitamins A, C and D. In India, we have hundreds
    of varieties of mangoes. They are of different sizes, shapes and colors. Mangoes have been cultivated in India since
    time immemorial. Even in our mythology and history there are stories of mangoes- the famous Indian poet Kalidasa
    sang its praise. Alexander the great, along with Hieun Tsang savored the taste of mangoes. The great Mughal king,
    Akbar is said to have planted over 100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga (modern Bihar). The mango is eaten ripe and is
    also used for pickles.

    The national tree of a country is one of the symbols of pride that is integral to the nation’s identity. To be
    considered as such, the tree must hold tremendous cultural significance that echoes through the country’s psyche.
    Being native to that country adds to the privileged status of the tree to be considered as a national symbol. The
    national tree is an instrument of projecting certain philosophical or spiritual values, which reside at the core of
    the country’s heritage.

    The national tree of India is the Banyan tree, designated formally as Ficus benghalensis. The tree is revered as
    sacred in Hindu philosophy. It is often a focal point of human establishment owing to its expansive form and shade
    provided. The tree is often symbol of the fabled ‘Kalpa Vriksha’ or the ‘Tree of Wish Fullfillment’ as it is
    associated with longevity and has important medicinal properties. The very size of the banyan tree makes it a
    habitat for a large number of creatures. For centuries the banyan tree has been a central point for the village
    communities of India. The banyan tree is massive not only from outside but it also sends new shoots from its roots,
    making the tree a tangle of branches, roots and trunks. The banyan tree towers magnificently over its neighbors and
    has the widest reaching roots of all known trees, covering several acres. The life of banyan tree is very long and
    is thought of as an immortal tree.

    The national emblem is a symbol of representation of a country which is unique in its design and structure. Any
    other country cannot use the national emblem of one country. Documents representing national interests are stamped
    or sealed by the national emblem. Many countries choose to have a national emblem despite having a national flag.
    The national emblem gives an identity to a country.



    The national emblems could be anything ranging from symbols of an animal to birds. The national animal, the national
    bird or the national flower can be adapted as a national emblem by a country.

    The national emblem of India was adopted in 1950 after the constitution of India came into force. The national
    emblem of India is an adaption of the Lion Capital of the Asoka at Sarnath. The structure of lion capital was a
    creation of Asoka in the third century BC. Sarnath is a place located in Uttar Pradesh, near Varanasi.

    The national emblem of India is structured to represent peace and goodwill in the evolving modern world. The
    national emblem of India has four lions in a circular loop. Among the four lions, three are visible when seen
    upfront. The fourth lion is invisible. The base on which the lion capital stands consists of a central Dharma Chakra
    with a bull on the right and galloping horse in the left. The dharma chakras that are located on the left and right
    side of the abacus can be slightly seen when looked upfront. The words “Satyameva Jayate” are inscribed in the
    bottom of the National emblem of India. This is a sacred phrase from the Hindu Upanishad. Mundaka.



    The lions of the National emblem of India signify power, courage, confidence and pride each. The other animals that
    we can see is a horse and bull but, an elephant and lion remain invisible. Al these animals have something to
    signify and represent. The horse is implied as to the horse of Buddha, which, he rode while exiting the citadel. The
    bull signifies Taurus, the zodiac sign of Buddha. The elephant denotes Buddha’s birth (as Buddha’s mother dreamt of
    a white elephant entering her womb during his birth). The lion denotes enlightenment.
